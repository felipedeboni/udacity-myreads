# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* before commit files `npm run precommit`
* running tests `npm test`
* check test stats `npm run test:coverage`
